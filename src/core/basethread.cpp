 * and destruction and colorful runtime errors).
 * getMyThreadSafe ensures that the TLS variable is reloaded at least once per iteration while we still do some
 * reuse of the address (inside the iteration) so we're not forcing to go through TLS for each myThread access
 * It's important that the compiler doesn't inline it or the optimazer will cause the same wrong behavior anyway.
